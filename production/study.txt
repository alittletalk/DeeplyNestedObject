The subject of my project: My dog YUTA 

 My dog Yuta was born on June 13th, 2020 and came to my home on August 18th. 
 He is now a 2-year-old Shiba Inu. He is adorable but naughty. He has normal white and yellow fur 
 and a smiley face. Both of his parents are Championship Dogs and he has two sisters and one brother(who is
 adopted by my dad's friend)
 The first time we took him home my mom was angry about it because she thought my dad and I could not 
 take responsibility for keeping a pet and she was not interested to help do that. 
 He was kept in my dad's company for one year before my mom allowed me to keep him at home. He is clever
 but haughty, having the personality of the cat as it is difficult to tell him to come over 
 when he is not in the mood to play with you. 
 After I left home to study abroad, my dad took this as a chance to bring him home. And now Yuta knew who
 is truly in charge at home and maintain a really good relationship with my mom. I feel like I am 
 losing my family status. 

 The Shiba Inu is a breed of hunting dog from Japan. 
 A small-to-medium breed, it is the smallest of the six original and distinct spitz breeds of dog native to Japan.
 "Inu" is Japanese and means "dog".
